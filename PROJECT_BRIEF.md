# Project Brief: Coreday

## 1. Core Mission

Coreday is an offline-first, privacy-centric application designed to be an all-in-one life manager. It empowers users to take control of their data by keeping it exclusively on their own devices.

## 2. Core Philosophy

- **Offline-First**: All features must be 100% functional without an internet connection. The application is a self-contained local tool.
- **Privacy by Design**: No user accounts, no cloud synchronization, no data tracking. The user's data never leaves their device.
- **Simplicity & Focus**: The user interface must be minimalist, clean, and distraction-free, prioritizing functionality and clarity over ornamentation.
- **Data Ownership**: Users have complete ownership of their data, with straightforward options to back up and export their information in open formats (JSON, CSV).

## 3. Target Audience

A privacy-conscious individual who is reasonably tech-savvy and seeks to organize their life digitally. They value tools that are powerful yet simple and distrust cloud-based services with their personal information. They are likely familiar with concepts like Markdown and personal budgeting.
